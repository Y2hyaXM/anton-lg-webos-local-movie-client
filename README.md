Anton is an application for watching movies from your computer or local server on a LAN. Ideally suited if you are a fan of movies on digital media that you have purchased and to which you have the rights to watch. Just share the movie folder and Anton will display it on the TV. You will no longer need a DVD on your TV. I do not support downloading movies from illegal sources and displaying them by Anton.
